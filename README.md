This system isn’t very difficult like handwriting recognition, which depends on various persons and their writing styles. Neural networks are widely applied to handwriting recognition areas. Neural Networks can be trained and then tested on handwritten digits. But in our system, it doesn’t need to be trained. The method we use is to find out the gradient variation of local image as the feature points.
